# Guess-The-Number
This is a very old project of mine, so the code might be of spaghetti type... Basically the computer guesses a 3-digit real number and doesn't show it to you. Your goal is to find this number by guessing a 3-digit number. If "n" of the positions of the digits on the number you guessed are in the same position in the number you are trying to find (the computer's number), then +n is written out. Likewise, if "m" of your digits are not in the correct positions, -m is written out. Lastly, if none of your digits exist in the computer's number, 0 is written out.
